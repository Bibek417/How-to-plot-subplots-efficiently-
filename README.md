# How-to-plot-subplots-efficiently- 
* Using subplots and putting multiple plots in one figure can be very useful in summarizing a lot of information in a small space. They are helpful in making reports or presentations. 
* Often while working with data, no matter big or small, sometimes you want to compare things side-by-side or plot different attributes or features individually. In such cases, a single figure is rendered insufficient. Thus, you need to know the art of working with subplots.
* Here In this repo I share with you a trick to efficiently plot the subplots using for loop and seaborn library. 
* you can plot lineplot, kdeplot, scatterplot etc
